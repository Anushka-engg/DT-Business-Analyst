# OPTION 3: GROWTH ANALYST 

This repository contains my completed tasks for the given assessment. The work is divided into **two deliverables**: PDF (Tasks 1 & 2) and Excel (Tasks 3 & 4).

## ✅ Task 1 – Cold Email Draft (PDF)

* **What I did:**

  * Wrote a **cold email** applying the **AIDCA framework** (Attention, Interest, Desire, Conviction, Action).
  * Structured the email to grab attention in the subject line, build interest with a relatable pain point, create desire by showcasing value, add conviction with proof, and end with a clear call to action.
* **Outcome:** A professional, persuasive cold email ready for outreach.

## ✅ Task 2 – MMF Logic Application (PDF)

* **What I did:**

  * Took an existing cold email and **analyzed it using the MMF (Message-Market-Fit) logic**.
  * Identified gaps such as unclear positioning, weak personalization, or lack of call-to-action.
  * Rewrote the email so that the **message matches the target market’s needs** more effectively.
* **Outcome:** An improved cold outreach copy aligned with MMF principles.

## ✅ Task 3 – Cold Email Re-engineering (Excel)

* **What I did:**

  * Created a structured **Before vs After** table in Excel.
  * Compared the **original cold email** with the **rewritten version**, highlighting improvements in tone, clarity, personalization, and call-to-action.
  * Used concise tabular formatting for clarity.
* **Outcome:** A clear demonstration of **copy transformation** showing exactly how a weak email can be optimized.

## ✅ Task 4 – Failure Layer Analysis (Excel)

* **What I did:**

  * Built a **4-column structured table**:

    1. **Scenario (MMF Logic)** – The situation or context.
    2. **Failure Layer** – What went wrong in the email.
    3. **Revised Prompt / Copy** – The improved version.
    4. **Justification** – Why this new version works better.
  * Applied this framework to multiple examples to show how cold emails can fail and how to fix them.
* **Outcome:** A systematic breakdown that highlights **mistakes + solutions** in cold email strategy.
